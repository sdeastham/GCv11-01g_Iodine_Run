README for run directory copied from GEOS-Chem UnitTest

This directory contains the following files or sets of files:

     (1) Makefile
     (2) input.geos configuration file
     (3) getRunInfo perl script
     (4) HEMCO_Config.rc configuration file
     (5) one or more data restart files
     (6) zero or more auxiliary data files

The Makefile enables build, run, print, and clean functionality from the 
prompt. Prior to use, open Makefile in a text editor and set the source code 
location (CODE_DIR) and optionally the log path (LOG_DIR) and log file 
prefix (VERSION). See the Makefile header for information about using make. 

The perl script getRunInfo is used by Makefile to extract grid resolution, 
simulation start and end times, meteorological data source, nested region, 
and simulation type from the input.geos configuration file.

Input.geos is a pre-configured text file containing default settings for 
run directory simulations. Adjust input.geos as needed for custom runs 
(e.g. start date, end date, output frequency, and output file diagnostics 
to include). 

HEMCO_Config.rc specifies emissions settings used by the Harvard/NASA
Emissions Component of GEOS-Chem. For detailed information about HEMCO, see ___.

All run directories include a tracer restart file that may be used to "spin
up" initial conditions for a simulation. Auxiliary data files and additional 
restart files may be included depending on the simulation type. 

For information about using run directories copied from GEOS-Chem UnitTest, 
visit the Creating GEOS-Chem Run Directories page on the GEOS-Chem wiki. For 
detailed instructions on getting started with GEOS-Chem, see the online 
GEOS-Chem User Manual.
